The Air Quality Decision Support System (SPK-KU) is designed to support decision making in determining air quality. Determination of air quality utilizes ISPU data input from the parameters of Particulate Matter 10 (PM₁₀), Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O₃), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂). The dataset of this system is ISPU data from 2010-2020 sourced from the DKI Jakarta Provincial Environmental Agency. The dataset consists of 15,013 data with a data completeness percentage of 74.24%. SPK-KU determines air quality using a Machine Learning model. The Machine Learning model processes data using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with a value of k = 9.
